The Legal Affairs Committee
¶
The Legal Affairs Committee was established in March 2007 and is responsible for establishing, and managing,
legal policies based on the advice of legal counsel and the interests of the Foundation. It reports to the board each month.
Questions for the Legal Affairs Committee should be raised on
LEGAL JIRA space
.
Most discussions are held on the public
legal-discuss@
mailing list. See the
legal-discuss@
archives
for previous discussions.
The Legal Affairs Committee (including VP of Legal Affairs) is staffed exclusively by volunteers
and is leveraging a pro-bono legal counsel. This means that while most requests are typically
resolved in a matter of few days, sometimes non-urgent requests can take longer. We will try
to acknowledge your request within a couple of days, but the actual resolution may take
much longer. For truly urgent matters always make sure to contact
vp-legal@apache.org
directly.
