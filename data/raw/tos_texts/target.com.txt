In order to receive birthday rewards, you also need to provide your birthday (month and day) in your Target Circle account.
To earn Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, you must identify yourself as a Target Circle member when you make a purchase at Target. When you make a purchase in Target stores, you can identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout by entering your mobile telephone number (provided that you have already enrolled as a member by providing your first and last name and a valid email address, as stated above, and have provided a valid U.S. mobile telephone number in your Target Circle account), by scanning the Wallet barcode in the Target App, or by paying with the Target Circle Card connected to your Target Circle account. As of January 18, 2023, Target Circle Cards can no longer be connected to a Target Circle account. If you connected your Target Circle Card to your Target Circle account prior to January 18, 2023, you can continue to use that Target Circle Card to identify yourself as Target Circle member as long as you do not change the Target Circle Card number connected to your Target Circle account. You need to provide a valid United States mobile telephone number in your Target account if you want to use your mobile telephone number to identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout. When you make a purchase on Target.com or in the Target App, you can identify yourself as a Target Circle member by signing into your Target account before you place your order.
For in-store transactions, if you identify yourself as a Target Circle member in a single transaction using multiple identification methods (e.g., provide your telephone number and pay with the Wallet) that are not associated with the same Target Circle account, Target Circle benefits will be awarded to and/or redeemed from only one of the associated Target Circle accounts, which will be determined at Target’s sole discretion.
Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes do not expire as long as you are actively participating in the Target Circle program.
Target Circle Rewards will expire if you have not earned or redeemed any Target Circle Rewards for one year.
As of September 28, 2023, if you have only provided a mobile telephone number, but have not completed your enrollment as a Target Circle member by providing your first and last name and your email address to associate with your account, then you will no longer be eligible to earn any new Target Circle Rewards; any Target Circle Rewards accumulated prior to September 28, 2023 will remain available for redemption (subject to the one-year expiration timeframe) if you complete your enrollment. If you do not participate in Target Circle for more than one year, Target reserves the right to expire any uncast Community Giving Program votes and/or delete your Target Circle account without notice to you. Neither Target Circle Rewards nor Community Giving Program votes will be reinstated if they expire. Community Giving Program votes may expire before the end of any particular Voting Period.
One Target Circle membership is permitted per guest. Your membership and any Target Circle benefits, including Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, are non-transferable and are subject to future Target Circle Terms. Neither Target Circle Rewards nor Community Giving Program votes can be combined or transferred between Target or Target Circle accounts.
Target Circle may be used only for personal, family and household purposes. You agree that you will not use Target Circle for business or commercial purposes. Resellers are expressly excluded from Target Circle. If you purchase items in violation of these Target Circle Terms, including purchasing items for resale, Target reserves the right to not award Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, to deduct improperly awarded Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, and/or to terminate your participation in Target Circle.
To the extent that you sign up for any benefit via an offer from a third party, any fees paid to such third party may be non-refundable and will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth by the third party, and disclosed to you, at the time of sign up.
Opting out of Target Circle and forfeiture of Target Circle Benefits.
If you no longer wish to be a Target Circle Member, you can opt out of Target Circle
here.
Opting out of Target Circle will not serve as cancellation of any Target Circle Card or Target Circle 360™ membership, if applicable to you; those cancellations are handled separately. Please call Target Card Services at 1-800-659-2396 for information about cancelling your Target Circle Card. To cancel your Target Circle 360 membership, please go to the
Membership section
of your Target account page.
If you opt out of Target Circle, any accumulated Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes will be deleted and you may not have access to other Target Circle benefits.
If you later re-join Target Circle, any deleted Target Circle Rewards or Community Giving Program votes will not be reinstated.
If you or Target delete, suspend or close your Target Circle account or your Target account, any accumulated Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes will be deleted and you may not have access to other Target Circle benefits.
Any deleted Target Circle Rewards or Community Giving Program votes will not be reinstated. In the event of any abusive or fraudulent activity related to Target Circle, and/or any violation of these Target Circle Terms, as determined in our sole discretion, Target reserves the right to make any adjustments to your Target Circle account and/or terminate your participation in Target Circle at any time.
If you enroll or participate in Target Circle using an invalid telephone number, such as a toll free number, international telephone number, invalid area code or invalid exchange, Target reserves the right to delete Target Circle Rewards, Community Giving Program votes and any other Target Circle benefit associated with the invalid telephone number. Target will not reinstate any deleted Target Circle Rewards, Community Giving Program votes or other Target Circle benefits if a valid telephone number is subsequently provided.
Target reserves the right to change, limit, modify or terminate Target Circle, the Target Circle Terms, and/or your membership, for any or no reason, at any time, with or without notice.

Each Target Circle Deal may be subject to a maximum number of items per transaction and/or uses per Target Circle member. Target Circle Deals are void if prohibited by law. Target Circle Deals expire at 11:59 PM (Pacific) on the stated date of expiration, unless otherwise noted. The Target Circle Deal value may not exceed the value of the item purchased. Target Circle Deals cannot be applied with a competitor price match; see Target’s
Price Match Policy
for full details. Target Circle Deals cannot be applied to previous purchases. All Target Circle Deals may not be available at all stores due to product availability. All Target Circle Deals have no cash value.
Target has the right to remove or cancel deals from Target Circle at any time and for any reason without notice.
For Target Circle Deals with a percentage discount, the actual savings may vary based on the item price at each store.

Target Circle Bonus
A Target Circle Bonus is a personalized offer that allows a member of Target Circle either to receive additional savings or promotional items or to earn Target Circle Rewards. These general terms apply to each Target Circle Bonus. Target Circle members can find any available Target Circle Bonus, including the dates and details for the specific Target Circle Bonus, on Target.com or in the Target App.
For any Target Circle Bonus to receive additional savings or promotional items:
To access any available Target Circle Bonuses, you must sign in to your Target Circle account and activate the Target Circle Bonus that you want to use on your Target Circle Deals page; Target Circle Bonuses will not be applied at checkout unless you choose to apply it to a specific transaction.
Only a Target Circle Bonus that is on your Target Circle Deals page and is valid at the time of purchase can be redeemed. If you print your barcode and a Target Circle Bonus expires or is canceled before you redeem it, that Target Circle Bonus will not be valid.
To redeem Target Circle Bonuses, you may use the Target App on your mobile device or a printout of your barcode. Photographs of barcodes will not be accepted. You may also redeem Target Circle Bonuses using the valid telephone number you provided for your Target Circle account.
Target Circle Bonuses may be valid in store and/or online, which will be stated in the terms of the Target Circle Bonus. Each Target Circle Bonus may be subject to a maximum number of items per transaction and/or uses per Target Circle member. Target Circle Bonuses are void if prohibited by law. Target Circle Bonuses expire at 11:59 PM (Pacific) on the stated date of expiration, unless otherwise noted. The Target Circle Bonus value may not exceed the value of the item purchased. Target Circle Bonuses cannot be applied with a competitor price match; see Target’s
Price Match Policy
for full details. Target Circle Bonuses cannot be applied to previous purchases. All Target Circle Bonuses may not be available at all stores due to product availability. All Target Circle Bonuses have no cash value.

All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted in connection with Target Circle Bonuses are subject to change at any time without notice.
Pricing, promotions and availability of items appearing in Target Circle Bonuses may vary by store location. Not all items are available in all markets. Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and Target shall have no liability of any kind for such errors.
For any Target Circle Bonus to earn Target Circle Rewards or other incentives:
You must activate the Target Circle Bonus, make qualifying purchases or complete qualifying actions as stated in the specific bonus, and identify yourself as a Target Circle member to receive the stated Target Circle Rewards or other incentives stated in the terms of the Target Circle Bonus.
A qualifying purchase for purposes of a Target Circle Bonus is a transaction that meets all of the purchase requirements described in your bonus, such as a minimum purchase threshold or the use of a Target service (e.g., Drive Up or Order Pickup). A qualifying purchase excludes all items that do not earn Target Circle Rewards, as listed elsewhere in these Target Circle Terms.
A pre-ordered item is eligible for a Target Circle Bonus only if it is shipped during the stated Target Circle Bonus period. Online, Same Day Delivery, Order Pickup and Drive Up purchases are eligible when the order is placed within the Target Circle Bonus period, but credit for the purchase isn’t received until the items ship or are ready for pickup, respectively. If qualifying purchases are returned, reversed or canceled, this may cause the transaction to no longer qualify for a Target Circle Bonus, which will be determined by Target in its sole discretion.
For any Target Circle Bonus with minimum purchase thresholds, the amount is calculated before other discounts (other than Target Circle Deals and sale prices) and taxes are applied. Your purchase subtotal should be more than the required purchase threshold to qualify.
Except for online orders that include Target Plus™ items or use the Same Day Delivery service, an online order qualifies as one purchase transaction even if items in the order are delivered separately or you use the Order Pickup or Drive Up service for some or all of the items in the online order. Online orders can include both Target Plus items and Target.com items. For purposes of a Target Circle Bonus, the Target Plus items and the Target.com items are separate purchase transactions and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase. If you use the Same Day Delivery service, the Same Day Delivery items are a separate purchase transaction from any other items in the online order, and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase.
Please allow 24 hours for your Target Circle Bonus to advance after in-store purchases. For online or Target App purchases, you will see your Target Circle Bonus advance once your order ships, is picked up or is delivered by a shopper if you use the Same Day Delivery service. Non-transaction Target Circle Bonus progress will reflect within 24 hours from the completion of the qualifying action.
For any Target Circle Bonus that awards Target Circle Rewards, Target reserves the right to deduct any Target Circle Rewards earned from a Target Circle Bonus from your Target Circle account if you no longer qualify for the Target Circle Bonus due to the return, reversal or cancelation of qualifying purchases or are no longer deemed to have completed the qualifying action.
Target Circle Bonuses are valid only for the fully enrolled Target Circle member who received the bonus and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. Limit one Target Circle Reward per Target Circle member per Target Circle Bonus. Not all Target Circle members receive Target Circle Bonuses and Target Circle Bonuses may vary. You must be a member of Target Circle at the time you make qualifying purchases or complete qualifying actions, respectively, and at the time the Target Circle Rewards are added to your Target Circle account. All other Target Circle Terms remain in effect, including the circumstances in which Target Circle Rewards expire.
Target Circle Rewards
As a member of Target Circle, you are eligible to earn Target Circle Rewards.
Target Circle Rewards can only be redeemed for certain merchandise or services at Target. Target Circle Rewards have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash.
Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App or specified qualifying actions at or specified by Target are eligible to earn Target Circle Rewards.
Target Circle Rewards are not earned on the following:
adult beverage purchases;
purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter;
purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, and Target Optical;
purchases made on the Shipt App and tips for shoppers;
purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express;
purchases of Target GiftCards;
purchases of Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards;

where otherwise prohibited by law.
Other restrictions may apply to earning Target Circle Rewards.
To redeem Target Circle Rewards you will need a Target Circle account, including your telephone number if you joined Target Circle by providing your telephone number. Once your Target account profile is complete, you can redeem Target Circle Rewards. To redeem on your next purchase in Target stores, elect to apply the Target Circle Rewards in your Target Circle account, and then either provide your mobile telephone number (if you provided your mobile telephone number) or scan your Wallet in the Target App during checkout. To redeem on Target.com or the Target App, apply the Target Circle Rewards to your next online order during checkout on Target.com or the Target App.
When you elect to redeem Target Circle Rewards, the entire amount will be applied to your next purchase as a Target discount. You cannot elect to apply only a portion of your Target Circle Rewards to a purchase. If your purchase is less than the amount of the Target Circle Rewards you have applied, the remaining amount may be unavailable for a second transaction until the first transaction has completed processing.
Target Circle Rewards are applied to the total purchase amount after all other discounts have been applied to the purchase transaction, except that if you use your Target Circle Card to pay for the purchase, any applicable Target Circle Card 5% discount will be applied to the transaction after the Target Circle Rewards are redeemed.
Target Circle Rewards cannot be redeemed for the following:
adult beverage purchases;
dairy product purchases;
purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter;
purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, Target Optical and Target Plus Partners;
purchases made on the Shipt app and tips for shoppers;
purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express;
purchases of Target GiftCards;
purchases of specialty gift cards and Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards;
purchases fulfilled via email (for example, video game digital downloads and digital specialty gift cards);
taxes, bottle deposits, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges;
payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds;
prior purchases; or
where otherwise prohibited by law.
Other restrictions may apply to redeeming Target Circle Rewards.
If you return an item that was part of a purchase in which you redeemed Target Circle Rewards, the amount of your redeemed Target Circle Rewards will be credited to your Target Circle Rewards balance (up to the value of the returned item), and any remaining refund amount will be refunded according to
Target’s return policy
. If items that earned Target Circle Rewards are returned, the associated Target Circle Rewards may be removed from your Target Circle Rewards balance. Target reserves the right to take your Target Circle Rewards to a negative balance (i.e., a balance in your account of less than zero Target Circle Rewards). In such event you will not have redeemable Target Circle Rewards until the balance of Target Circle Rewards in your account is greater than zero.
Beginning April 7, 2024, Target Circle members will no longer earn Target Circle Earnings rewards (the former name of Target Circle Rewards) at a rate of 1% of the eligible purchase amount every time a member uses a non-Target Circle Card form of payment. Any previously earned Target Circle Earnings rewards will roll over as Target Circle Rewards on the same terms and conditions as existed at the time they were received, subject to all other requirements set forth in these Target Circle Terms.
For Target Circle members who had a 1% Target Circle Earnings rewards balance as of September 4, 2019, the unspent earnings were transferred to an eGiftCard which can be found in your Target account or in the Wallet in the Target App. The eGiftCard does not expire and can be redeemed for merchandise or services other than gift cards and prepaid cards at Target stores or on Target.com but cannot be redeemed for cash or credit except where required by law. View the eGiftCard for terms and conditions.
Target Circle Digital Manufacturer Coupons
Manufacturer coupons are digital manufacturer coupons available through Target Circle. Each coupon is valid for a single use per Target Circle account, and savings do not stack with paper manufacturer coupons. The terms and conditions applicable to each coupon will vary and will be stated at the time of adding the coupon to your Target Circle Deals page.
To access any available coupons, you must sign in to your Target Circle account and activate the coupons that you want to use on your Target Circle Deals page; coupons are not applied at checkout unless you choose to apply it to the specific transaction.
Only those Target Circle coupons that are activated on your Target Circle Deals page at the time of purchase can be redeemed. If you print your list and a coupon expires or is canceled before you redeem the coupon, that coupon will not be valid.
To redeem Target Circle coupons, you may use the Target App on your mobile device or a printout of your barcode. Photographs of barcodes will not be accepted. You may also redeem coupons using the valid telephone number you provided for your Target account.
Target has the right to remove or cancel coupons from Target Circle, and from your Target Circle Deals page, at any time and for any reason without notice.
For coupons with a percentage discount, the actual savings may vary based on the item price at each store.
The numbers shown for total savings at the individual and global level for Target Circle coupons are specific to each account and do not reflect combined totals or the impact of any returns or exchanges that may be associated with those transactions.
All Target Circle coupons are subject to local and state laws and regulations. Such offers may be restricted or void in some locations. Target shall have no liability for the impact such laws or regulations may have on the ability to utilize such offers.
All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted on Target Circle are subject to change at any time without notice.
Pricing, promotions and availability of items appearing in Target Circle coupons may vary by store location. Not all items are available in all markets. Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and Target shall have no liability of any kind for such errors.
Birthday Reward
When your birth date is included in your Target account, on or near your birthday you will receive a birthday reward. The reward can be accessed either in the Target App or on Target.com. The reward will contain the full details on how to redeem the reward, and will include any applicable redemption restrictions and expiration date. Birthday rewards given will vary and are limited to one award per year per Target Circle account.
Community Giving Program
Target may run multiple local Community Giving Programs. By participating in Target Circle you have access to one Community Giving Program associated with your preferred store location as designated in your Target account settings. In each Community Giving Program, Target will make a Donation to be allocated among Nonprofits. Eligibility of the Nonprofits will be determined by Target in its sole discretion. Multiple store locations may be tied to a single Community Giving Program. The Nonprofits, Donation amount and Voting Period may vary by Community Giving Program. The allocation of the Donation among the Nonprofits for each Community Giving Program will be based on the percentage of votes each Nonprofit receives during the applicable Voting Period for that Community Giving Program. With respect to each Community Giving Program, the list of participating Nonprofits, the dates comprising the applicable Voting Period, and the Donation to be divided among the Nonprofits can be seen by logging on to and viewing the Target Circle voting screen on the Target App or at Target.com/circle.
As a member of Target Circle, every time you make an eligible purchase and identify yourself as a Target Circle member, you earn one vote. Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App are eligible to earn Community Giving Program votes.
Votes are not earned on a purchase transaction that is comprised only of one or more of the following: adult beverage purchases; purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter; purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, and Target Optical; purchases made on the Shipt App and tips for shoppers; purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express; purchases of Target GiftCards; purchases of Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards; taxes, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges; payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds; prior purchases; or where otherwise prohibited by law.
To cast Community Giving Program votes, follow the instructions located under Target Circle benefits in your Target account via the Target App or Target.com/circle. You must have access to internet through your own device to participate. You must be a Target Circle member in good standing to participate. Votes have no cash value and do not represent an actual donation to any Nonprofit; rather, they are just the means to vote for allocation of the Donation from Target in each Community Giving Program. Target’s tally of votes is final. Each vote is intended for one-time use by you. If Target detects any inappropriate conduct related to votes or votes made outside the above guidelines, votes may be disregarded. In the event any aspect of Target Circle, including the voting, is disrupted in any way, Target reserves the right to allocate the Donation for any affected location in a fair and equitable manner, as determined by Target.
From time to time, Target may provide the opportunity to cast Community Giving Program votes to direct additional or supplemental Donations. These opportunities may have terms and conditions in addition to or different from those provided in the Target Circle Terms. Unless otherwise stated, the Target Circle Terms will apply to any such opportunity.

All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted in connection with Target Circle Bonuses are subject to change at any time without notice.
Pricing, promotions and availability of items appearing in Target Circle Bonuses may vary by store location. Not all items are available in all markets. Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and Target shall have no liability of any kind for such errors.
For any Target Circle Bonus to earn Target Circle Rewards or other incentives:
You must activate the Target Circle Bonus, make qualifying purchases or complete qualifying actions as stated in the specific bonus, and identify yourself as a Target Circle member to receive the stated Target Circle Rewards or other incentives stated in the terms of the Target Circle Bonus.
A qualifying purchase for purposes of a Target Circle Bonus is a transaction that meets all of the purchase requirements described in your bonus, such as a minimum purchase threshold or the use of a Target service (e.g., Drive Up or Order Pickup). A qualifying purchase excludes all items that do not earn Target Circle Rewards, as listed elsewhere in these Target Circle Terms.
A pre-ordered item is eligible for a Target Circle Bonus only if it is shipped during the stated Target Circle Bonus period. Online, Same Day Delivery, Order Pickup and Drive Up purchases are eligible when the order is placed within the Target Circle Bonus period, but credit for the purchase isn’t received until the items ship or are ready for pickup, respectively. If qualifying purchases are returned, reversed or canceled, this may cause the transaction to no longer qualify for a Target Circle Bonus, which will be determined by Target in its sole discretion.
For any Target Circle Bonus with minimum purchase thresholds, the amount is calculated before other discounts (other than Target Circle Deals and sale prices) and taxes are applied. Your purchase subtotal should be more than the required purchase threshold to qualify.
Except for online orders that include Target Plus™ items or use the Same Day Delivery service, an online order qualifies as one purchase transaction even if items in the order are delivered separately or you use the Order Pickup or Drive Up service for some or all of the items in the online order. Online orders can include both Target Plus items and Target.com items. For purposes of a Target Circle Bonus, the Target Plus items and the Target.com items are separate purchase transactions and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase. If you use the Same Day Delivery service, the Same Day Delivery items are a separate purchase transaction from any other items in the online order, and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase.
Please allow 24 hours for your Target Circle Bonus to advance after in-store purchases. For online or Target App purchases, you will see your Target Circle Bonus advance once your order ships, is picked up or is delivered by a shopper if you use the Same Day Delivery service. Non-transaction Target Circle Bonus progress will reflect within 24 hours from the completion of the qualifying action.
For any Target Circle Bonus that awards Target Circle Rewards, Target reserves the right to deduct any Target Circle Rewards earned from a Target Circle Bonus from your Target Circle account if you no longer qualify for the Target Circle Bonus due to the return, reversal or cancelation of qualifying purchases or are no longer deemed to have completed the qualifying action.
Target Circle Bonuses are valid only for the fully enrolled Target Circle member who received the bonus and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. Limit one Target Circle Reward per Target Circle member per Target Circle Bonus. Not all Target Circle members receive Target Circle Bonuses and Target Circle Bonuses may vary. You must be a member of Target Circle at the time you make qualifying purchases or complete qualifying actions, respectively, and at the time the Target Circle Rewards are added to your Target Circle account. All other Target Circle Terms remain in effect, including the circumstances in which Target Circle Rewards expire.
Target Circle Rewards
As a member of Target Circle, you are eligible to earn Target Circle Rewards.
Target Circle Rewards can only be redeemed for certain merchandise or services at Target. Target Circle Rewards have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash.
Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App or specified qualifying actions at or specified by Target are eligible to earn Target Circle Rewards.
Target Circle Rewards are not earned on the following:
adult beverage purchases;
purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter;
purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, and Target Optical;
purchases made on the Shipt App and tips for shoppers;
purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express;
purchases of Target GiftCards;
purchases of Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards;
taxes, bottle deposits, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges;
payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds;
prior purchases; or
where otherwise prohibited by law.
Other restrictions may apply to earning Target Circle Rewards.
To redeem Target Circle Rewards you will need a Target Circle account, including your telephone number if you joined Target Circle by providing your telephone number. Once your Target account profile is complete, you can redeem Target Circle Rewards. To redeem on your next purchase in Target stores, elect to apply the Target Circle Rewards in your Target Circle account, and then either provide your mobile telephone number (if you provided your mobile telephone number) or scan your Wallet in the Target App during checkout. To redeem on Target.com or the Target App, apply the Target Circle Rewards to your next online order during checkout on Target.com or the Target App.
When you elect to redeem Target Circle Rewards, the entire amount will be applied to your next purchase as a Target discount. You cannot elect to apply only a portion of your Target Circle Rewards to a purchase. If your purchase is less than the amount of the Target Circle Rewards you have applied, the remaining amount may be unavailable for a second transaction until the first transaction has completed processing.
Target Circle Rewards are applied to the total purchase amount after all other discounts have been applied to the purchase transaction, except that if you use your Target Circle Card to pay for the purchase, any applicable Target Circle Card 5% discount will be applied to the transaction after the Target Circle Rewards are redeemed.
Target Circle Rewards cannot be redeemed for the following:
adult beverage purchases;
dairy product purchases;
purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter;
purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, Target Optical and Target Plus Partners;
purchases made on the Shipt app and tips for shoppers;

purchases of Target GiftCards;
purchases of specialty gift cards and Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards;

taxes, bottle deposits, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges;
payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds;
prior purchases; or
where otherwise prohibited by law.
Other restrictions may apply to redeeming Target Circle Rewards.
If you return an item that was part of a purchase in which you redeemed Target Circle Rewards, the amount of your redeemed Target Circle Rewards will be credited to your Target Circle Rewards balance (up to the value of the returned item), and any remaining refund amount will be refunded according to
Target’s return policy
. If items that earned Target Circle Rewards are returned, the associated Target Circle Rewards may be removed from your Target Circle Rewards balance. Target reserves the right to take your Target Circle Rewards to a negative balance (i.e., a balance in your account of less than zero Target Circle Rewards). In such event you will not have redeemable Target Circle Rewards until the balance of Target Circle Rewards in your account is greater than zero.
Beginning April 7, 2024, Target Circle members will no longer earn Target Circle Earnings rewards (the former name of Target Circle Rewards) at a rate of 1% of the eligible purchase amount every time a member uses a non-Target Circle Card form of payment. Any previously earned Target Circle Earnings rewards will roll over as Target Circle Rewards on the same terms and conditions as existed at the time they were received, subject to all other requirements set forth in these Target Circle Terms.
For Target Circle members who had a 1% Target Circle Earnings rewards balance as of September 4, 2019, the unspent earnings were transferred to an eGiftCard which can be found in your Target account or in the Wallet in the Target App. The eGiftCard does not expire and can be redeemed for merchandise or services other than gift cards and prepaid cards at Target stores or on Target.com but cannot be redeemed for cash or credit except where required by law. View the eGiftCard for terms and conditions.
Target Circle Digital Manufacturer Coupons
Manufacturer coupons are digital manufacturer coupons available through Target Circle. Each coupon is valid for a single use per Target Circle account, and savings do not stack with paper manufacturer coupons. The terms and conditions applicable to each coupon will vary and will be stated at the time of adding the coupon to your Target Circle Deals page.
To access any available coupons, you must sign in to your Target Circle account and activate the coupons that you want to use on your Target Circle Deals page; coupons are not applied at checkout unless you choose to apply it to the specific transaction.
Only those Target Circle coupons that are activated on your Target Circle Deals page at the time of purchase can be redeemed. If you print your list and a coupon expires or is canceled before you redeem the coupon, that coupon will not be valid.
To redeem Target Circle coupons, you may use the Target App on your mobile device or a printout of your barcode. Photographs of barcodes will not be accepted. You may also redeem coupons using the valid telephone number you provided for your Target account.
Target has the right to remove or cancel coupons from Target Circle, and from your Target Circle Deals page, at any time and for any reason without notice.
For coupons with a percentage discount, the actual savings may vary based on the item price at each store.
The numbers shown for total savings at the individual and global level for Target Circle coupons are specific to each account and do not reflect combined totals or the impact of any returns or exchanges that may be associated with those transactions.
All Target Circle coupons are subject to local and state laws and regulations. Such offers may be restricted or void in some locations. Target shall have no liability for the impact such laws or regulations may have on the ability to utilize such offers.
All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted on Target Circle are subject to change at any time without notice.

Community Giving Program
Target may run multiple local Community Giving Programs. By participating in Target Circle you have access to one Community Giving Program associated with your preferred store location as designated in your Target account settings. In each Community Giving Program, Target will make a Donation to be allocated among Nonprofits. Eligibility of the Nonprofits will be determined by Target in its sole discretion. Multiple store locations may be tied to a single Community Giving Program. The Nonprofits, Donation amount and Voting Period may vary by Community Giving Program. The allocation of the Donation among the Nonprofits for each Community Giving Program will be based on the percentage of votes each Nonprofit receives during the applicable Voting Period for that Community Giving Program. With respect to each Community Giving Program, the list of participating Nonprofits, the dates comprising the applicable Voting Period, and the Donation to be divided among the Nonprofits can be seen by logging on to and viewing the Target Circle voting screen on the Target App or at Target.com/circle.
As a member of Target Circle, every time you make an eligible purchase and identify yourself as a Target Circle member, you earn one vote. Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App are eligible to earn Community Giving Program votes.
Votes are not earned on a purchase transaction that is comprised only of one or more of the following: adult beverage purchases; purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter; purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, and Target Optical; purchases made on the Shipt App and tips for shoppers; purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express; purchases of Target GiftCards; purchases of Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards; taxes, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges; payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds; prior purchases; or where otherwise prohibited by law.
To cast Community Giving Program votes, follow the instructions located under Target Circle benefits in your Target account via the Target App or Target.com/circle. You must have access to internet through your own device to participate. You must be a Target Circle member in good standing to participate. Votes have no cash value and do not represent an actual donation to any Nonprofit; rather, they are just the means to vote for allocation of the Donation from Target in each Community Giving Program. Target’s tally of votes is final. Each vote is intended for one-time use by you. If Target detects any inappropriate conduct related to votes or votes made outside the above guidelines, votes may be disregarded. In the event any aspect of Target Circle, including the voting, is disrupted in any way, Target reserves the right to allocate the Donation for any affected location in a fair and equitable manner, as determined by Target.
From time to time, Target may provide the opportunity to cast Community Giving Program votes to direct additional or supplemental Donations. These opportunities may have terms and conditions in addition to or different from those provided in the Target Circle Terms. Unless otherwise stated, the Target Circle Terms will apply to any such opportunity.

DMCA Notice - Notice & Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
Target’s policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Copyright-infringing materials found on the Site can be identified and removed via our process listed below, and you agree to comply with such process in the event you are involved in any claim of copyright infringement to which the DMCA may be applicable.
If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide Target’s copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying Target that your copyrighted material has been infringed. Target does not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, Target will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. Target may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, Target is required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content ("Alleged Infringer"). The Alleged Infringer is allowed under the law to send Target a counter-notification. Notices and counter-notices are legal notices distinct from regular Site activities or communications. We may publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.
To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by fax, regular mail, or email only. We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice.
A DMCA notice must:
Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, "My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located].");
Identify the Content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Site. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;
Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available);
If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);
Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law";
Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed";
Be signed; and
Be sent to our DMCA designated agent at the following address:

THE SITE AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS , PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE (COLLECTIVELY, THE "SITE CONTENTS") ARE PROVIDED BY TARGET ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TARGET MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SITE, THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SITE CONTENTS, OR THAT EMAILS SENT FROM TARGET ARE FREE OF MALWARE OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TARGET DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE AND THE SITE CONTENTS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE.
CERTAIN PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS MAY SEPARATELY PROVIDE LIMITED REPRESENTATIONS AND/OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THEIR PRODUCTS. THIS DISCLAIMER DOES NOT APPLY TO SUCH PRODUCT WARRANTIES.
TARGET DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE NUTRITION, INGREDIENT, ALLERGEN, AND OTHER PRODUCT INFORMATION ON OUR SITE IS ACCURATE OR COMPLETE SINCE THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS OR SUPPLIERS AND ON OCCASION MANUFACTURERS MAY MODIFY THEIR PRODUCTS AND UPDATE THEIR LABELS. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT RELY SOLELY ON THE INFORMATION PRESENTED ON OUR SITE AND THAT YOU CONSULT THE PRODUCT’S LABEL OR CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER DIRECTLY IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC DIETARY CONCERN OR QUESTION ABOUT A PRODUCT.
On the Site, we may display names, marks, products, advertisements, or services of third parties, pop-up texts, or links to third-party sites. If you decide to link to any such third-party sites, you do so entirely at your own risk.
Jurisdictional Issues
The Site is controlled and operated by Target from the United States, and is not intended to subject Target to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Target does not represent or warrant that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction other than the United States. In choosing to access the Site, you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the Site’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.
Limitation of Liability
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TARGET OR ITS EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE. THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY THAT APPLIES TO ALL LOSSES AND DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (WHETHER GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, INCOME OR PROFITS), WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF TARGET HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SITE, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE, OR THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, BY YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE RIGHTS ADDITIONAL TO THOSE CONTAINED HEREIN. THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY TO RESIDENTS OF NEW JERSEY. WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTS OF NEW JERSEY, TARGET OR ITS EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, OR ANY MATERIALS THEREIN UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARE THE RESULT OF TARGET’S NEGLIGENT, FRAUDULENT OR RECKLESS ACTS OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT.
EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND TARGET. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND TARGET. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE(S).
Indemnification & Defense
As a condition of the use of the Site, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Target and its respective employees, directors, officers, agents, vendors and suppliers from and against any liabilities, losses, investigations, inquiries, claims, suits, damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (each, a "Claim") arising out of or otherwise relating to Claims alleging facts that if true would constitute a breach by you of these Terms & Conditions, or any User Content submitted by you.

Arbitration Agreement
Please read this section carefully. Except as the Terms & Conditions otherwise provided, you waive your rights to try any claim in court before a judge or jury and to bring or participate in any class, collective, or other representative action.
Agreement to Binding Arbitration
You and Target agree that in the event of any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with (1) the site or (2) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, application, or validity of these Terms & Conditions, such claim, dispute or controversy will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms & Conditions (the “Arbitration Agreement”).
Exceptions to Arbitration
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of arbitration: (1) either you or Target can bring an individual claim in small claims court in the United States of America consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits that may apply, provided that it is brought and maintained as an individual claim; and (2) you agree that you or Target may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
Jury Trial & Class Action Waiver
Except as the Terms & Conditions otherwise provide, you and Target acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and Target may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim.
If any term in the immediately preceding paragraph is found to be unenforceable with respect to any claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that such claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.
Governing Law & Arbitration Rules
The Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section. If the FAA is found not to apply to any issue that arises under this section or the enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of Minnesota.
The arbitration will be conducted under the then current and applicable Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at
www.adr.org
Initiating Arbitration
If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send a written notice (“Notice”), by first class or certified mail to Target.com Guest Services, P.O. Box 9350, Minneapolis, MN 55440-9350. If Target intends to seek arbitration, Target will send a Notice to the current billing address on your account. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim and the specific relief sought. If the parties cannot reach an agreement within 30 days from the receipt of the Notice, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings.
A form to initiate arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA site at
www.adr.org
. In addition to filing this form with the AAA, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send such copy to Target at Target Law Department, 1000 Nicollet Mall, TPS-3155, Minneapolis, MN 55403, and Target will send such copy to the current billing address on your account or to your attorney, if you have retained one.
Fees
For claims of $75,000 (US Dollars) or less, you will pay the filing fee specified in the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.  Target will pay any additional required filing fees, and all administration and arbitrator fees (collectively, “Arbitration Fees”) unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. For claims over $75,000 (US Dollars), payment of the AAA filing fee and Arbitration Fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.
Location & Procedure
If your claim is for $10,000 (US Dollars) or less, you may choose to have arbitration conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephone hearing, by an in-person hearing in the county of your residence, or as otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. If your claim exceeds $10,000 (US Dollars), the location of the arbitration and the parties’ right to a hearing will be determined in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.
Arbitrator’s Decision
The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Target waives its right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration.
Choice of Law, Forum Selection, & Jury Waiver
Except as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement section above, all matters relating to your access to or use of the site and all matters arising out of or related to these Terms & Conditions, will be governed by the applicable laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Minnesota, without regard to Minnesota’s choice of law principles. Unless you and Target agree otherwise, in the event that it is determined or these Terms & Conditions provide that a claim should not proceed through arbitration, you agree that any claim or dispute (with the exception of a claim or dispute appropriately lodged in any small claims court in the United States of America) shall be resolved in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. If subject matter jurisdiction (including diversity jurisdiction) does not exist in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota for any such claim, then the exclusive forum and venue for any such action shall be the courts of the State of Minnesota located in Hennepin County, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. As to any proceeding in court, you and Target both waive your right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable.
The choice-of-law and forum-selection provisions in this section do not apply to the Arbitration Agreement or to any arbitrable disputes as provided by the Arbitration Agreement section. Instead, as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, the FAA shall apply to any such disputes.
Miscellaneous
These Terms & Conditions, including policies and information linked from or incorporated herein or otherwise found on the Site, constitute the entire agreement between you and Target with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements, and proposals with respect to the Site. No provision of these Terms & Conditions shall be waived except pursuant to a writing executed by the party against whom the waiver is sought. No failure to exercise, partial exercise of, or delay in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms & Conditions shall operate as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition. Except as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, if any provision of these Terms & Conditions is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired. You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any of your rights or obligations under these Terms & Conditions without our express prior written consent. We will not be responsible for failure to fulfill any obligation due to causes beyond our control.
