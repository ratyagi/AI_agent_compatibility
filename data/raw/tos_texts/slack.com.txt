Last Updated: April 25, 2023
The Main Services Agreement and the Slack Supplemental Terms (together, the "
Slack Terms
”) describe your rights and responsibilities when using our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the “
Services
”).
If you are “Customer”, the Slack Terms govern your access to and use of our Services. If you are being invited to a workspace set up by Customer, the User Terms of Service (the “
User Terms
”) govern your access to and use of the Services.
Please read the Slack Terms carefully because they are a binding agreement between you and us. The Main Services Agreement is available at the following Salesforce link, as Slack is a Salesforce company:
