Privacy Policy
, which describes how we process personal data.
IMPORTANT ARBITRATION NOTICE

1. Who We Are

2. Account Creation and Access
a. Minimum age
. You must be at least 18 years old, or the minimum age required to use our Services in your location, whichever is higher.
b. Your Account
. To use our Services, you may need to create an account. You agree to provide correct information and allow us to communicate with you about our Services. You may not share your account login information with anyone or make your account available to others. You are responsible for all account activity, including the activities of an end user who accesses the Services via your account, and agree to promptly contact us if you notice any unauthorized access to your account by emailing security@stability.ai.
c. Corporate Domains
. If you use an email address owned by your employer or another organization, your account may be linked to the organization’s enterprise account.  The organization’s administrator may be able to monitor and control the account, including viewing your Inputs and Outputs (as defined below).
3. Using our Services
a. Compliance
.
You may access and use our Services only in compliance with our Terms, our
Acceptable Use Policy
, and supplemental terms or guidelines we may post on our Services.  In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other Stability or third-party terms applicable to any portion of our technology, such as open source license terms, those other terms will control for that portion of the Stability technology and to the extent of any conflict.
b. Use Restrictions
. You may not access or use, or help another person to access or use our Services in any of the following circumstances:
In violation of any applicable law or regulation.
To develop products or services that compete with our Services, including to develop or train any artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, or models, or resell our Services, except as expressly approved by Stability.
To reverse engineer our Services, except when these restrictions are prohibited by applicable law.
To crawl or scrape data from our Services or to access our Services through automated or non-human means (such as through a bot or script), or use any method to extract data from our Services other than as permitted under these Terms or as otherwise expressly permitted by Stability.
To use our Services to obtain unauthorized access to any system or information, or to deceive or manipulate anyone.
To infringe, misappropriate, or violate intellectual property or other legal rights.
To engage in any other conduct that restricts any person from using our Services, or that we reasonably believe exposes us (or any of our users, affiliates, or any other third party or individual) to any liability, damages, or harm, including reputational harm.
To represent or imply that an Output (as defined below) generated from our Services was human-generated, when it was not.
To abuse, harm, or interfere with our Services, or bypass our systems or security measures.
To buy, sell, or transfer API keys from, to or with a third party.
4. Inputs and Outputs
You may submit text, images, or other inputs or prompts (“Inputs”) to our Services to generate corresponding outputs (“Outputs”) that are based on your Inputs.
a. Rights to Inputs and Outputs
. You are responsible for all Inputs you submit to our Services, including Inputs your end users submit to our Services via your account. By submitting Inputs to our Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions that are necessary to provide Input to our Services. You also represent and warrant that your submission of Inputs to us will not violate our Terms, our
Acceptable Use Policy
, or any applicable laws or regulations. As between you and Stability, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you retain your ownership right in the Inputs that you submit. Subject to your compliance with our Terms, we assign to you all of our right, title, and interest (if any) in the Outputs. So as between Stability and you, you own the Output (to the extent permitted by applicable law).  Because of how our Services and artificial intelligence generally work, multiple users might get similar results based on similar Inputs.  So the rights we assign to you only apply to your specific Outputs, not to other users’ or third parties’ Outputs.
b. Reliance on Outputs
. Generative artificial intelligence is technology that is still developing and Outputs may not always contain accurate information or be as you intended. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of any Outputs before using or sharing them.  Outputs should not be used for any critical decisions without independent human review.  Please also note that Outputs are not created by Stability and do not reflect Stability’s views.
c. Our use of Inputs and Outputs
. As described in our
Privacy Policy
, we may use Inputs and Outputs to improve and develop our Services (but you can opt-out to prevent us from using your Inputs and Outputs to train our models,
learn more
), comply with applicable law, enforce our terms and policies, and to keep our Services safe.
5. Supplementary Resources (e.g., LoRAs)
.
To the extent you are using Dream Studio, this Section 5 applies to you, but it does not apply to all other “Services.”
For users of Dream Studio, you may have the ability to train and share parameter-efficient supplementary resources, including Low-Rank Adaptations (“LoRAs”), Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptations (“DoRAs”), Bi-Dimensional Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptations (“BoRAs”), or similar technologies (collectively, “LoRAs”), on our Services.
a. For Trainers of LoRAs
Your content
.  Any data you upload or incorporate into a LoRA is considered your content.  As between you and Stability, you are solely responsible for the LoRA and any outputs generated from, including ensuring compliance with applicable laws and our
Acceptable Use Policy
.
Sharing your LoRA
.  If you choose to share your LoRA,
you grant to Stability a nonexclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to host, use, reproduce, and make available  to others on the Services; and
you grant to users of your model a nonexclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, store, and create derivative works from your LoRA and its output.
you must ensure that any information you publish about your LoRA is complete, accurate, and not misleading.
Removal
.  Stability may remove your LoRA from Dream Studio at any time, for any reason, without notice.
b. For Users of LoRAs
.  You should only use LoRAs that you trust.  These LoRAs are user-generated and may be removed by either the trainer or Stability at any time without notice.  If you encounter a LoRA that appears to violate our policies or applicable law, please report it to us.
6. Feedback
We appreciate your feedback. If you choose to provide us feedback, you agree that we may use the feedback without any obligation or payment to you.
7. Fees, Subscriptions, and Service Credits

c. Subscriptions
. When you sign up for a subscription, you agree:
Automatic renewal
. If you sign up for a paid subscription, we will automatically charge your payment method on each agreed-upon periodic renewal date until you cancel.
Cancellation

Fees
. We have the right to make changes to the fees applicable to your subscription from time to time, with advance notice. You agree to pay the increase in fees for Services you receive after receiving notice of the increase, unless you cancel the subscription before the renewal term to which the increase in fees will apply.
d. Service Credits.
We may offer the option to prepay for certain Services through the purchase of credits, which is the amount you have paid in advance for use of our Services.  We may also offer service credits for free as part of a promotional program.
Non-Refundable
.  Service credits are not currency and are not redeemable for money or any sum of monetary value.  Service credits are non-refundable and may be used only in connection with the applicable Service.
Expiration
. Unused service credits (that were issued on or after the effective date of these Terms) expire one year after the date of purchase or issuance, unless otherwise specified.
Balance
. You are solely responsible for verifying the proper amount of service credits that have been added to or deducted from your balance.  Your service credit balance is not a digital wallet, bank account, stored value account, or other payment device.
Non-Transferrable
.  We prohibit any purported transfers, sales, gifts, or trades of service credits.  Evidence of such purported transfers may result in termination of your service credits and your use of our Services, without any refund.
Termination
.  We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your service credit balance, in compliance with applicable law.
These terms do not override any local laws about your rights as it relates to fees, subscriptions, and service credits.
8. Third-Party Services
Our Services may use or be used in connection with third-party software, services, or integrations.  By using our Services, you acknowledge that your Input, including any personal data you include within that Input, may be shared with such third-party service to enable functionality.  Our Services may also incorporate third-party models or APIs (
here
), which may change from time to time as we update our Services.  When you use our Services, you may not use any Outputs to train a model that competes with that third party (
see, e.g.
, OpenAI
terms
).  By using our Services, you agree to comply with the terms of these third parties.
9. Software
We may offer manual or automatic updates to our software. If there is any conflict between these Terms and any other Stability or third-party terms applicable to any part of our software, such as open source license terms, such other terms will control for that portion of the Stability software and to the extent of the conflict.
10. Ownership and the DMCA
Our Services are owned, operated, and provided by us and our affiliates, licensors, distributors, and service providers (collectively “Providers”). We and our Providers retain all of our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to our Services. Other than the rights of access and use expressly granted in our Terms, our Terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in or to our Services.
We have implemented the procedures described in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”), 17 U.S.C. § 512, regarding reporting alleged copyright infringement and removing or disabling access to the infringing material on our website.

TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, OUR PROVIDERS, OR OUR OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, INVESTORS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “STABILITY PARTIES”) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO OUR SERVICES, THE INPUTS / OUTPUTS, OR THESE TERMS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF THE DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE.

12. General Terms
a. Changes to our Services
. We may periodically update our Services, including add or remove features or Services, without advance notice.  Unless we specifically agree otherwise in a separate agreement, we reserve the right to modify or discontinue our Services in our discretion and without advance notice. We will not be liable for any changes to our Services.

d. Entire agreement
. These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Stability regarding our Services, except for any Service-specific supplemental terms.
e. Termination or Changes to our Services
. You may stop accessing or using our Services at any time. We may, for various reasons, deprecate or upgrade certain Services at any time without advance notice.  We may also suspend or terminate your access to our Services (including any subscriptions) at any time without advance notice, particularly if we believe that you have breached these Terms or if we must do so to comply with applicable law.  If you believe we have suspended or terminated your access to our Services in error, you can file an

13. In case of disputes
YOU AND STABILITY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS.  Except for the “governing law and exclusive jurisdiction” provision at the end of this document, this Section 13 applies only to those in the United States or Canada.  Section 13 of this Agreement shall be referred to as the “Arbitration Agreement.”
a. MANDATORY ARBITRATION.
This Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all claims that arose or were asserted before, on, or after the effective date of your acceptance of these Terms. You and Stability agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration.  The activities in these Terms relate to interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern this Arbitration Agreement.
b. Opt Out.
You may opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions by emailing a written notice of your decision to opt-out to
legal@stability.ai
.  The notice must be sent within 30 days of account creation or within 30 days of any updates to these arbitration terms having taken effect.  If you opt out of an update, the previous agreed upon arbitration terms will apply, and you will remain bound to arbitrate under that agreement.
c. Informal dispute resolution
.  Before taking legal action, we both agree to try to resolve any disputes informally by email.  You can contact us at
legal@stability.ai
.
If we cannot resolve the issue within 60 days, either of us can start the arbitration process.  During this 60-day period, if either of us requests a meeting to discuss a settlement, we both agree to attend.  If a party is represented by counsel, the party’s counsel may participate in the conference, but both parties (you and Stability) shall also fully participate in the conference.  Any statute of limitations will be tolled while we try to resolve issues through this informal process.  Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. An arbitration shall be dismissed if it was filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. If an arbitration is dismissed because a party willfully failed to comply with these informal dispute resolution procedures, the arbitrator may order the non-compliant party to pay any arbitration filing fees and costs incurred by the other party.
d. Arbitration forum
.  If we are unable to resolve the dispute, either of us may begin arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (
here
).
e. Arbitration procedures
.  The arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator, with exclusive authority to resolve any dispute, including those relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of the Arbitration Agreement, except that the state or federal courts of San Francisco will have the authority to adjudicate any dispute about the validity of the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant dispositive motions.  The arbitrator may also not receive information about settlement offer amounts from either party before deciding on the final award.  The arbitration will be by video conference if possible, unless the arbitrator requires an in-person hearing.
f. Exceptions
.  Informal dispute resolution or arbitration is not required for:  (a) individual claims from small claims court; or (b) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our Services, or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.
g. CLASS AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS
.  We both agree that disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and not as a class action, class arbitration, or representative action.  We both agree to sever any request for public injunctive relief and litigate that issue in court after finishing arbitration for the remaining claims.  This does not, however, prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement.
We both irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action or proceeding.
h. Grouped arbitrations
.  If 25 or more claimants file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar disputes within 90 days of each other, then we both agree that NAM will administer them in groups of up to 50 claimants each, with each group proceeding as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing.  The arbitrator shall resolve arbitrations within a group on an individual basis, and no final award from an arbitrator shall have preclusive effect in another arbitration.
i. Equitable relief.
You agree that if you violate Section 3 (Using our Services): (1) no adequate remedy exists at law, (2) it would be difficult to calculate the damages caused, and such violations would cause permanent harm, and (3) injunctive relief is the best solution.  You waive any opposition to this injunctive relief, and will not require us to prove actual damages or to post bond or security for such relief.
j. Governing law and exclusive jurisdiction
. Our Terms will be governed by, and construed and interpreted according to California laws without giving effect to conflict of law principles. We both agree that any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, and we both submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. By accessing our Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other jurisdictions.
