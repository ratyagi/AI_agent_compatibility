TERMNS
Hi Neel,
At Laguna Beach circa May 2013, you were decided by popular vote (coordinated by Josh Tien) as the closest person to being one of TERMS. So there you are. With you, we're not just TERMS, we're TERMNS. It has a much nicer ring to it anyway...

You can ask the universe for all the signs you want, but ultimately, we see what we want to see when we’re ready to see it.

"Both of my parents were very successful. So I was taught a lot about success growing up, but I wasn’t taught a lot about happiness. For example, I realized recently that I don’t have any photographs with my friends from college."
"Are you saying you didn’t have any moments in college worth photographing?"
"No, there were plenty of moments. But I never felt the need to capture them. I was so busy trying to be the best, I never really paused to appreciate what I had."

The fact that this episode is 10 years old and Beyoncé is even more relevant today is just fabulous
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

"The army stationed me down South when I was younger, and I couldn’t even use the same bathroom as white people. But things have changed so much. The younger generation isn’t nearly as racist. I’ve been sitting here for fifty years. So much has changed. This neighborhood used to be all black. A white person couldn’t even walk down this street. All the races kept to themselves. Now you’ve got Indians talking to Pakistanis, blacks talking to whites, everybody is here and learning from each other’s cultures. I’ve been sitting here for 50 years. Things are getting better."
O Captain! My Captain!
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
But O heart! heart! heart!
O the bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.
Happy Birthday, Terms!

Wild Geese
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
