notice to you. If you do not agree with these Terms, including the Dispute Resolution section, your sole

provisions of this Section 16 with respect to any claim, dispute, or controversy that you may
have against Forbes and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective
current or former members, officers, directors, and employees, arising out of, relating to, or
connected in any way with the Website, Forbes Channels, these Terms, our Digital or Print Terms
of Sale, or any applicable end user license agreement (which are incorporated by reference
herein) (a âDisputeâ) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may arise out of
such Dispute (an âActionâ). The terms of Section 16 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions
or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or
such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to
which you have personally initiated an Action prior to agreeing to these Terms.
16.2.
Class Action and Jury Waiver.
THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR
COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY ONLY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE IN THAT PARTYâS
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS

16.4.
Governing Law.
These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and shall be
construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving any regard to its conflict of
law principles. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory
Arbitration Provision (below) is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal
Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (âFAAâ).
16.5.
Venue.
For any Action allowed to proceed in court, or to enforce the terms of this
Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the State courts of
the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
16.6.
Initial Dispute Resolution.
The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any
Dispute, directly through consultation and good faith negotiations pursuant to the following
process (the â
Informal Dispute Resolution Process
â), which shall be a precondition to
either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
16.6.1.
If you have a Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the
Dispute to us via email to
customersupport@forbes.com
. If we have a
Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to the contact information we have for you.
16.6.2.
Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or
videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve
informally the Dispute.
16.6.3.
You agree to participate in the conference personally. If you are represented by counsel,
your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate
in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may
participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully
participate in the conference.
16.6.4.
The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties
engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph.
16.6.5.
If the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing party receiving the notice,
then either you or we may initiate an action in a small claims court that has jurisdiction
over the Dispute and is reasonably close to your place of residence or work, or initiate an
arbitration as described below.
16.7.
Mandatory Arbitration.
If the Parties do not reach an agreed upon solution pursuant to the
Informal Dispute Resolution Process, you and Forbes each agree that any Dispute must be brought
on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final, non-appealable, and binding
arbitration (â
Arbitration
â) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the â
Arbitrator
â). The Arbitrator must have experience and expertise with the subject matter
of the Dispute and be a former federal or state court judge.
16.7.1.
If a Party brings an Arbitration without following the Informal Dispute Resolution Process,
it is grounds for dismissal, and such Party is required to pay any reasonable costs and fees
of the other Party.
16.7.2.
The Parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this
Section, good-faith meet-and-confer efforts require that each Party propose at least three
arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms.
16.7.3.
If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on
an arbitrator, either Party may petition the State courts of the State of New York or the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to appoint an arbitrator
pursuant to a process whereby the court provides the Parties with a panel of five potential
arbitrators meeting the requirements herein for an arbitrator, each Party strikes one
arbitrator, and the court appoints the arbitrator from the remaining arbitrators on the
panel based on the arbitratorâs qualifications and expertise, and the requirements of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and-confer efforts require that
each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these
Terms.
16.7.4.
The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMSâ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
Procedures or other comparable rules that the parties agree to. The selection of JAMS rules
does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator.
16.7.5.
The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means or by a submission of
documents in lieu of a personal appearance by the parties. However, the arbitrator shall
have discretionary authority to require a face-to-face meeting, if it determines that such
face-to-face meeting is necessary for a fundamentally fair hearing. If the Party seeking
Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such
Party's counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration
proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not
able to attend the conference.
16.8.
Arbitration Costs
. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you
initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much
of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems
necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of
the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted
in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with
the arbitration (other than your attorneysâ fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered
under the arbitration rules or applicable law).
16.9.
Small Claims Court Claims
. Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all disputes
through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or
claims within the scope of that courtâs jurisdiction. Any appeal of the decision in such small
claims court shall be subject to these arbitration provisions.
16.10.
Dispute Resolution Only If A Tribunal Has Ruled That
Arbitration Is Prohibited.
If a court with appropriate jurisdiction prohibits
arbitration of a dispute in accordance with this Section 16, then the state or federal courts in
New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute, and to the maximum extent permitted
by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms and any dispute arising out of
or related in any way to these Terms or their subject matter or formation (including
non-contractual disputes), will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York and the United States, without giving effect to any conflict of law
principles.
16.11.
Intellectual Property Claims.
Notwithstanding the arbitration
provisions herein, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to
violate our intellectual property rights, We may seek injunctive or other
appropriate relief in the state courts of the State of New York or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and you consent to
exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
16.12.
No Opt Out Rights.
You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute
Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of
Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services and
to terminate your account.
16.13.
Forbes Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution
Provision.
At any time, Forbes may terminate its agreement to Section 16.
That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated.
16.14.
Arbitration Agreement Survival.
This arbitration agreement will
survive the termination of your relationship with Forbes.
General
17.1.
These Terms shall be deemed to include all other notices, policies, disclaimers, and other terms
contained on the Website and Forbes Channels; provided, however, that in the event of a conflict
between such other terms and the terms of these Terms, the terms of these Terms shall control
except where expressly stated otherwise. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, nothing
contained in these Terms shall take precedent over Forbesâ
Privacy Statement
17.2.
If any provision is deemed to be unlawful or unenforceable, that shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions. Any failure of Forbes to enforce or exercise any
provision of this Agreement or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or
provision. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify
any provision of these Terms. The section titles used in this Agreement are purely for convenience
and carry with them no legal or contractual effect. In the event of termination of these Terms for
any reason, you agree that the following provisions will survive: the provisions regarding the
limitations on your use of Content, the license(s) you have granted to Forbes, and all other
provisions for which survival is equitable or appropriate. Forbes may assign its rights and duties
under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you.
